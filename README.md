# recommendation_system
Description
This project is a movie recommendation system using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Recommenders. It consists of two main stages: retrieval and ranking. The retrieval stage identifies a subset of movies that a user might be interested in, and the ranking stage sorts these movies based on predicted ratings.
